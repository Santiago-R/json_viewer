# JSON Viewer

> Motivation: Launch custom data visualizations straight from the explorer window

This repository is an example of custom behavior when launching files. A python script may be set up for default execution of a file extension, for example JSON.

## Files

- `json_viewer.py`: Simple JSON viewer via Plotly.
- `launcher.bat`: Batch file to launch files through the script.

## Example outcome
